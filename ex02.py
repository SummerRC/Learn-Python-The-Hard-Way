# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

# Acomment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by Python.

print "I could have code like this."    # and the comment after is ignored.

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run."

print "This will run!"

# 测试：在不指定 utf-8 编码的情况下, 注释里的中文字符是否会对脚本的运行产生影响？
# 答案是：Yes
